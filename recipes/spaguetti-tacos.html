    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My kids wanted these spaghetti tacos after seeing them on one of their favorite TV shows.
        They're very quick and easy to make.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>12 crisp taco shells</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Return pasta to the pot. Pour in spaghetti sauce and mix thoroughly until reheated.</li>
        <li>Place taco shells onto a microwave-safe plate, then fan out into a circular shape so the edges of the taco shells overlap slightly. Microwave on high until warm and crisp, 30 to 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Spoon pasta mixture into warm taco shells. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese onto each taco.</li>
    </ol>
